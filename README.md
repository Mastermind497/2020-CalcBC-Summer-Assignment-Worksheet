# 2020 AP Calculus BC Summer Assignment

This is a repository which contains a PDF Version of the AP Calculus BC Summer Assignment for Livingston High School. Since the problems come from the textbook, and students are required to re-write the question, this repository takes all of the questions that are assigned and combines them into a worksheet format with enough space to show work. Sadly, it starts from Section 1.3, so students will have to do Sections 1.1 and 1.2 by hand. 

**Note: By using this worksheet, you agree to bear sole responsibility for any issues that arise. If you find any typos or errors, please submit an issue or pm me so I can fix it**
